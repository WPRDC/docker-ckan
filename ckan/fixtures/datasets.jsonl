This data includes housing unit counts, occupancy status for housing units, population totals, and population by race Hispanic/Latino origin, voting-age population (age 18+), and group quarters counts. The Census Bureau will be releasing additional data, including more detailed population and household statistics from the 2020 Census in the future.

Each record (row) consists of one unique relationship between a 2000 Census tract/2010 Census tract spatial set where a spatial set is the unique area shared by the record’s 2000 and 2010 tracts. Changes in tracts involve area, land area, population, and/or housing unit counts. Specifically, each record specifies the area, land area, population, and housing unit counts that were transferred to the record’s 2010 tract (TRACT10) from the record’s 2000 tract. The 2000 area (AREA00), land area (AREALAND00), population (POP00), and housing unit count (HU00) for the record is the standardized 2010 value for the record’s 2000 tract (TRACT00). These are the values to use when comparing 2010 population and housing unit counts to those values in the 2000 Census for a particular tract.\r\n\r\nThe relationship file provides the information necessary to conduct a decennial analysis between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses for a particular tract.

This file includes any record where either TRACT00 or TRACT10 in pa42trf.txt was 3, indicating Allegheny County. Tracts are required to follow county lines, however, some of the records had another county specified as TRACT00 with Allegheny County as TRACT10 or vice versa. The 2010 boundary change file for Pennsylvania does not show any boundary changes for Allegheny County. According to Chris Briem, an economist from the University Center for Social and Urban Research (UCSUR), the Census Bureau updated its Pennsylvania geography between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses. The changes in the geography forced adjustments in the tract boundaries, which are reflected in the relationship file. After looking at the 2000 tract and county shape files, he said 2000 tracts line up with 2000 county lines. Likewise, after looking at the 2010 tract and county shape files, he said 2010 tracts line up with 2010 county lines. If working with a 2000 tract (TRACT00) for which the adjustment involved a non-Allegheny County tract, use the POP00 and HU00 values in the same way as with tracts involving only Allegheny County.\r\n\r\nAllegheny Census tract boundaries changed significantly after the 2000 Census. Chris Briem said that two factors influenced these changes:\r\n\r\n• The City of Pittsburgh and other areas within Allegheny County had experienced dramatic population declines, and many tracts were merged to accommodate the population requirement. This phenomenon may also be seen in other regions of the country.\r\n\r\n• The Census Bureau changed how tracts were handled in unpopulated areas. Starting with the 2010 Census, unpopulated areas were divided into tracts separately from populated areas.","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"bcb6d6a8-8d32-4abb-a377-77d7358d94c2","last_modified":"2020-04-02T17:00:28.400303","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Allegheny County Relationship File","package_id":"f7ccd6d1-b38e-4b08-aba1-b78b4e9483ca","position":1,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"18467af0-65e7-486f-a184-381a06fb1bf3","size":214949,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/f7ccd6d1-b38e-4b08-aba1-b78b4e9483ca/resource/bcb6d6a8-8d32-4abb-a377-77d7358d94c2/download/pa_allegheny_42003.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2019-12-08T17:15:06.080577","datastore_active":true,"description":"This file contains information about the fields in the 2000 to 2010 Census Tract Relationship file.","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"7a27e5b5-da62-43df-9790-00c0d21d88eb","last_modified":"2019-12-12T01:31:27.067220","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Data Dictionary","package_id":"f7ccd6d1-b38e-4b08-aba1-b78b4e9483ca","position":2,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"9e14fbab-2560-41fd-8fdc-78335c6ae2d9","size":25457,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/f7ccd6d1-b38e-4b08-aba1-b78b4e9483ca/resource/7a27e5b5-da62-43df-9790-00c0d21d88eb/download/data-dictionary.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2019-12-08T17:05:08.413378","datastore_active":false,"description":"This file includes information about Census tracts and the relationship file.

Agencies are dispatched via a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system. This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:\r\n  \r\n* Aggregated event location to census block groups.  \r\n* Aggregated call date/time to quarter and year. \r\n* Shortened call types to remove potentially identifying information. \r\n* Flagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.  \r\n* Checked frequency of calls with sensitive health information: \r\n    * If the number of calls (in a particular category related to sensitive health information) for a certain quarter/year and census block group was greater than or equal to 5, the call description was included.  \r\n    * If less than 5, the call description was redacted. \r\n\r\nEvents requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.\r\n\r\nThe call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller. The calls are not later updated with a disposition or correction if the original description was inaccurate. For example, if EMS is dispatched to the scene of a stroke, but the person actually had a heart attack, that record would not be updated later with the correct description. \r\n\r\nA small subset of the CAD data had no call type recorded. These records are preserved with a \"null\" in the Description_Short field. Redacted call types are listed as \"Removed\".\r\n\r\nThe 19 municipalities that dispatch their own EMS, Fire, and/or Police services are called \"ringdown municipalities\". These are subject to change. The list can be found in the Ringdown Municipalities 2019 resource.\r\n\r\n**Due to the size of these tables, you may experience 504 Gateway Timeout errors when trying to download the first two resources below.

A Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction. A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction. An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel. A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway. A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street. A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together. Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown. Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update. Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature. A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together. Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update. An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads. Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways. A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation. A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature. A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed. \r\n\r\nCenterlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement. One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement. Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present. For roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement. \r\n\r\nAll attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated. For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR. If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004. The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified. \r\n\r\nThe ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps. Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed. In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads. Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset. In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area. Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area. The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the \"-ID\" (UserID) field. In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset. When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field \"UPDATE_YEAR\" is set to 2004. All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values. All Street Centerline database data with an \"UPDATE_YEAR\" of 2004 should be verified before used. In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection. Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range. All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for \"SystemID\" and \"UserID\".\r\n\r\nThis dataset was previously harvested from Allegheny County’s GIS data portal.

The conservatorship process, defined by PA’s 2008 Act 135, seeks to provide “a mechanism to transform abandoned and blighted buildings into productive reuse”, ideally creating “an opportunity for communities to modernize, revitalize and grow, and to improve the quality of life for neighbors who are already there”. Conservators petition to take possession of the building and oversee the “operation, management and improvement of the building in order to bring it into compliance with all municipal building and housing code requirements”. Conservators can be can be lienholders, non-profit groups, or residents/business owners who are in the proximity of the property in question. More information can be found on the Pennsylvania General Assembly website: https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=2008&sessInd=0&act=135\r\n\r\nConservatorship data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the conservatorship process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here. (All of the fields except the `last_activity` field are expected to be set at the initial filing of the case. The `last_activity` field is the only one we expect to update on a regular basis; it represents the date of the most recent activity on the case.)\r\n\r\nTo view the detailed conservatorship filings for each property represented in this dataset, please visit the Department of Court Records Civil/Family Division [Website Search Page](https://dcr.alleghenycounty.us/Civil/LoginSearch.aspx), and enter the Case ID for a docket. This will provide detailed information about each conservatorship case by docket , including litigants, attorneys, non-litigants,  docket entries, events, copies of documents, property information (included in the docket report) and services.","num_resources":1,"num_tags":11,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

As new cases are passed to the Allegheny County Health Department they are investigated by case investigators. During investigation some cases which are initially determined by the State to be in the Allegheny County jurisdiction may change, which can account for differences between publication of the files on the number of cases, deaths and tests. Additionally, information is not always reported to the State in a timely manner, delays can range from days to weeks, which can also account for discrepancies between previous and current files.\r\nTest and Case information will be updated daily. This resource contains individuals who received a COVID-19 test and individuals whom are probable cases. Every day, these records are overwritten with updates. Each row in the data reflects a person that is tested, not tests that are conducted. People that are tested more than once will have their testing and case data updated using the following rules: \r\n \r\n1. Positive tests overwrite negative tests.\r\n2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests overwrite antibody or antigen (AG) tests.\r\n3. The first positive PCR test is never overwritten. Data collected from additional tests do not replace the first positive PCR test. \r\n\r\n_*Note:* On April 4th 2022 the Pennsylvania Department of Health no longer required labs to report negative AG tests. Therefore aggregated counts that included AG tests have been removed from the Municipality/Neighborhood files going forward. Versions of this data up to this cut-off have been retained as archived files._\r\n\r\nIndividual Test information is also updated daily. This resource contains the details and results of individual tests along with demographic information of the individual tested. Only PCR and AG tests are included. Every day, these records are overwritten with updates. This resource should be used to determine positivity rates.\r\n\r\nThe remaining datasets provide statistics on death demographics. Demographic, municipality and neighborhood information for deaths are reported on a weekly schedule and are not included with individual cases or tests. This has been done to protect the privacy and security of individuals and their families in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Municipality or City of Pittsburgh Neighborhood is based off the geocoded home address of the individual tested.\r\n\r\nIndividuals whose home address is incomplete may not be in Allegheny County but whose temporary residency, work or other mitigating circumstance are determined to be in Allegheny County by the Pennsylvania Department of Health are counted as \"Undefined\".\r\n\r\nSince the start of the pandemic, the ACHD has mapped every day’s COVID tests, cases, and deaths to their Allegheny County municipality and neighborhood. Tests were mapped to patient address, and if this was not available, to the provider location. This has recently resulted in apparent testing rates that exceeded the populations of various municipalities -- mostly those with healthcare providers. As this was brought to our attention, the health department and our data partners began researching and comparing methods to most accurately display the data. \r\nThis has led us to leave those with missing home addresses off the map. Although these data will still appear in test, case and death counts, there will be over 20,000 fewer tests and almost 1000 fewer cases on the map. In addition to these map changes, we have identified specific health systems and laboratories that had data uploading errors that resulted in missing locations, and are working with them to correct these errors.\r\n\r\nDue to minor discrepancies in the Municipal boundary and the City of Pittsburgh Neighborhood files individuals whose City Neighborhood cannot be identified are be counted as “Undefined (Pittsburgh)”.","num_resources":14,"num_tags":11,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

While lead has been eliminated from gasoline, household paint, and solder, you can still be exposed to lead from many different sources including dust containing lead from pre-1978 lead paint, paint chips, contaminated soils, water, ceramic plates, bowls, and glasses, and imported candy, toys, cosmetics, and jewelry\r\n\r\nLead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that no safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, academic achievement, and other behavioral issues.\r\n\r\nAs of January 1, 2018, Allegheny County requires every child under age six to be tested for lead exposure. The first of two tests will be conducted when a child is approximately 9-12 months old, and the second test will take place around the child’s second birthday. According to the Allegheny County Health Department, 53% of County children born in 2016 were tested for lead between the ages of nine to 12 months. This share has risen from 30% of County children born in 2009.\r\n\r\nChildren are initially tested with a capillary, or “finger prick” blood test. If an elevated level of lead is found, a venous blood test will be administered to confirm the result. For more information on the testing methods, please see the Allegheny County Health Department’s Lead Exposure in Allegheny County report, released in September, 2018. The Allegheny County Health Department currently treats confirmed blood lead level tests with 5 µg/dL or more of lead as elevated. This measurement is based on the CDC’s reference level for public health action, established in May 2012.\r\n\r\nIf a child under age 6 tests with a confirmed blood lead level of 5 µg/dl and above, ACHD offers a free home inspection. The goal of this inspection, along with XRF readings, sampling of dust, soil, and water, is to help identify any sources of lead exposure in the home. The inspection includes identifying possible alternative sources of lead exposure from jewelry, toys, cosmetics, parent occupations and/or hobbies. Inspectors also educate the family about how good nutrition can mitigate absorption of lead and immediate steps the family can take to reduce lead exposure in the home. ACHD also offers free lead testing for the uninsured or underinsured at its Immunization clinic, and at WIC offices in McKeesport and Wilkinsburg. \r\n\r\nThe Allegheny Lead Safe Homes Program currently provides free home repairs to keep families safe from lead paint. This program will test for lead-based paint in the home and will aid with repairs and prevention education to Allegheny County homeowners or renters who meet income requirements and whose home is built before 1978. All work is done in a lead-safe manner. Eligible residents must either have a child under 6 years or a pregnant woman in the household.  \r\n\r\nFor additional information about how to use this data accurately and responsibly, please refer to the County's [data guide](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/26a17866-0b8b-4eb6-bc0c-6ebcfdd19741/resource/a8f69277-6328-4421-a508-8b2100d753e3/download/wprdc-lead-data-guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nInformation appearing in this description was drawn from the following sources: \r\n\r\nLead Exposure in Allegheny County (September 2018 [pdf report](https://alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Programs/Special_Initiatives/Lead/Lead-paper-9-6-final.pdf))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County Health Department’s Lead Exposure Prevention ([Website](https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Lead-Exposure-Prevention.aspx)) \r\n\r\nAllegheny County Health Department’s Lead Testing ([Website]( https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Testing.aspx))\r\n\r\nData about lead in Allegheny County ([Website](\r\nhttps://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Lead-in-Allegheny-County.aspx))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County Health Department’s Approach to Lead ([Website]( https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Approach-to-Lead.aspx))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County Lead Safe Homes program information ([Website](\r\nhttps://www.alleghenycounty.us/economic-development/residents/lead-safe-homes-program.aspx))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County’s Article XXIII Blood Lead Testing Regulation ([pdf document]( https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Article-23-Blood-Lead-Level-Testing.pdf))","num_resources":7,"num_tags":14,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

Lakes are large standing bodies of water greater than 5 acres in size. Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater than 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream edges and River Edges.  The Ohio River, Monongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major River polygons.  All other River and Stream polygons are coded as River. A Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic feature.  Drainage Canals are differentiated from streams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or bottom stabilized to prevent erosion for the predominant length of the feature.  Streams may have had some stabilization done, but are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large standing bodies of water greater than five acres in size.  Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater than one acre in size and less than five acres in size.  Reservoirs are manmade embankments of water.  Included in this definition are both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are greater than one acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and Hidden Drainage Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water flows through a manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not being updated but will be preserved.  If a drainage feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the associated drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a structure to which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage.  They are normally constructed of concrete and steel and are anchored to the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling. Mooring Cells do not currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will be added. Locks are devices that are used to control flow or access to a hydrologic feature.  The edges of the Lock are captured.  Dams are devices that are used to hold or delay the natural flow of water.  The edges of the Dam are shown.","num_resources":6,"num_tags":8,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

The foreclosure process enables a lender to take possession of a property due to an owner's failure to make mortgage payments.  Mortgage foreclosure differs from tax foreclosure, which is a process enabling local governments to take possession of a property if the owner fails to pay property taxes.\r\n\r\nAs Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state, a lender files for foreclosure through the court system.  Foreclosure data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket, and a  mortgage foreclosure docket created to help homeowners maintain ownership of their property following an initial filing. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the foreclosure process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here, but we hope to add all filings for a case in the coming months.\r\n\r\nAfter a property enters the foreclosure process, several potential outcomes are possible. Some of the more common outcomes include:  borrowers may come to an agreement with the lender for unpaid debt; borrowers may sell the property to satisfy part or all of the debt; borrowers may voluntarily relinquish ownership to the lender; lenders may decide not to pursue the foreclosure any further; and the property may proceed all the way through a sheriff sale, where it is sold to a new owner.\r\n\r\nBefore September 2022, the data presented here included only the final filing for the month in which each case (represented by Case ID) is opened; since then the feed has changed so we now have a new `last_activity` field, which gets updated whenever there is a new filing in the case with the date of the last filing for the month. The `last_activity` value gives some indication of which cases are still ongoing. (However, the new feed does not include the `docket_type` field, so these are blank for cases started after August 2022.) To view the detailed mortgage foreclosure filings for each property represented in this dataset, please visit the [Department of Court Records Website](https://dcr.alleghenycounty.us/Civil/View/CaseSearchByCaseNumber.aspx), and enter the Case ID for a property to pull-up detailed information about each foreclosure case, including parties, docket entries, and services.\r\n\r\n# Changelog \r\n\r\n2022-12-14: Loaded data back to September (which had been missing due to the schema migration). Added a new `last_activity` field. Data since September 2022 is missing the `docket_type` value, for now those new values will be set to '' (empty string).\r\n\r\n# Visualizations","num_resources":1,"num_tags":11,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

In conjunction with the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), and under the framework of their SAFE Aquatic Data Standard, a selection of fields was identified to be pulled from aquatic facility inspection reports into this compiled dataset. \r\n\r\nThe fields represent information that would be collected at a typical inspection of an aquatic facility not only in Allegheny County, but in other jurisdictions across the United States. These fields include things like disinfectant level, if the water was clear during the inspection, if appropriate safety equipment was present & in good repair, etc. The ultimate hope is that if other jurisdictions establish an online open data portal with information that corresponds with the SAFE Aquatic Data Standard, data could be compared and analyzed in a standardized way across the US, something that cannot currently be accomplished in an efficient manner due to the lack of a standardized data collection system. Allegheny County is one of only a handful of other jurisdictions that was selected by NEHA to be the pioneers of this new SAFE aquatic data standard.

However, the tech is new, and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017, we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs, either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people’s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people’s feelings or understanding of this new technology.\r\nWe hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.\r\n\r\nWe conducted our 2017 survey in two parts. First, we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members, yielding 321 responses (out of 2,900) via email. Once we closed the survey, we launched it again, but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website, social media channels, and a few news articles, we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region), for a combined total of 1,119 responses.\r\n\r\nRegarding the 2019 survey: In total, 795 people responded. BikePGH solicited responses from their blog, website, and email list. There were also a few local news articles about the survey. While many questions were kept similar to the 2017 survey, BikePGH wanted to dig a bit deeper into regulations as well as demographics this time around.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 follow up survey also aims to see how the landscape has changed, and how specifically, Pittsburghers on bike and on foot feel about sharing the road with AVs so that we’re all better prepared to deal with this new reality and help make sure that it is introduced as safely as humanly possible.","num_resources":7,"num_tags":34,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2016-06-10T10:18:33.820220","description":"Bike Pittsburgh is transforming our streets and communities into vibrant, healthy places by making them safe and accessible for everyone to bike and walk.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh’s bright future is built on a diverse transportation network that safely connects all people to their destinations.

It counts asthma-related visits to the Emergency Department (ED), hospitalizations, urgent care visits, and asthma controller medication dispensing events.\r\n\r\nThe asthma data was compiled as part of the Allegheny County Health Department’s Asthma Task Force, which was established in 2018. The Task Force was formed to identify strategies to decrease asthma inpatient and emergency utilization among children (ages 0-18), with special focus on children receiving services funded by Medicaid. Data is being used to improve the understanding of asthma in Allegheny County, and inform the recommended actions of the task force. Data will also be used to evaluate progress toward the goal of reducing asthma-related hospitalization and ED visits.\r\n\r\nRegarding this data, asthma is defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [(IDC-10) classification system code J45.xxx](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#/J40-J47). The ICD-10 system is used to classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures in the U.S. healthcare system. \r\n\r\nChildren seeking care for an asthma-related claim in 2017 are represented in the data. Data is compiled by the Health Department from medical claims submitted to three health plans (UPMC, Gateway Health, and Highmark). Claims may also come from people enrolled in Medicaid plans managed by these insurers. The Health Department estimates that 74% of the County’s population aged 0-18 is represented in the data.\r\n\r\nUsers should be cautious of using administrative claims data as a measure of disease prevalence and interpreting trends over time. Missing from the data are the uninsured, members in participating plans enrolled for less than 90 continuous days in 2017, children with an asthma-related condition that did not file a claim in 2017, and children participating in plans managed by insurers that did not share data with the Health Department. \r\n\r\nData users should also be aware that diagnoses may also be subject to misclassification, and that children with an asthmatic condition may not be diagnosed. It is also possible that some children may be counted more than once in the data if they are enrolled in a plan by more than one participating insurer and file a claim on each policy in the same calendar year.","num_resources":1,"num_tags":8,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

This will be fixed soon.\r\n- The numerical range for `latest_inspection_score` is currently 0-62,  but the system is being adjusted, and eventually these scores will be adjusted to a 1-4 scale.","num_resources":1,"num_tags":5,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-02-12T13:34:12.747165","description":" ","id":"9ecaff80-fb4a-457b-8141-e53f7c991890","image_url":"20150212-183412.702478k1fmeh7gvmv2viv3h0wjnn89f.gif","is_organization":true,"name":"city-of-pittsburgh","revision_id":"8d60e904-2a50-4162-9032-80fda6b6e5f3","state":"active","title":"City of Pittsburgh","type":"organization"},"owner_org":"9ecaff80-fb4a-457b-8141-e53f7c991890","private":false,"related_documents":"https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/pli-demolition-engagement","relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2023-01-27T22:00:12.180442","datastore_active":true,"description":"","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"0a963f26-eb4b-4325-bbbc-3ddf6a871410","last_modified":"2023-05-04T03:56:15.585080","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Condemned Properties","package_id":"f9006efd-eac0-467a-a0d2-3b3a9a59cd39","position":0,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"3cab1590-2115-4fc3-b13b-cda8b5532b04","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/0a963f26-eb4b-4325-bbbc-3ddf6a871410","url_type":"datapusher"}],"revision_id":"a4a6ea9b-7358-4e7d-a4a6-40ca50bb380b","state":"active","tags":[{"display_name":"_etl","id":"11a2ac1d-0f6e-4f88-a1d0-8eca46578f77","name":"_etl","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"condemned","id":"cae1bdd8-6b4f-4b76-ae44-c2dfa55ccfe2","name":"condemned","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"parcel_id","id":"93270390-2ab1-4824-b3dd-98cfa264125a","name":"parcel_id","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"pli","id":"642da27b-ed75-4b9e-aed0-aaa650733d1a","name":"pli","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"properties","id":"4743a91b-0501-4e63-8535-5b213d9cbba1","name":"properties","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null}],"temporal_coverage":"","title":"Condemned and Dead-End Properties","type":"dataset","url":null,"version":null}

The reports are based on visual inspection by Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) inspectors. The primary basis for the inspections are the rules and regulations contained in “Article VI, Houses and Community Environment”. The entire health and housing code can be found at: http://www.achd.net/housing/pubs/pdf/hrules.pdf. \r\n\r\nAll ownership data listed on the inspection reports is collected from multiple sources, and is subject to change at any time. Changes in ownership may not be reflected on the posted reports. \r\nThe following terms, definitions, and descriptions will be useful as you review the ACHD inspection reports. \r\n\r\n__Property Locations:__ A property location is typically a street address for a parcel of land which may or may not include a structure. Each location is associated with a city, borough, or township, state, and ZIP code, with geographic divisions by 2010 census tract. \r\n\r\n__Service Requests, Types of Service Requests, and Inspection Reports:__ A service request is a recorded instance, created when a complaint is made about a specific property. Each case has a unique service request number and cites a specific property location in violation.\r\n\r\n__Inspection Report and Violation Details:__ Each inspection report cites the sections of Article VI for which a property is found to be in violation. These citations are known as Violations. The nature of the violation is described in the inspection report. \r\nEach inspection report lists the property address or location, the date of inspection, a service request number, service request type, and a narrative description of the violation with a suggested remedy. It is possible that a property address may have more than one service request, particularly when multiple apartments at the same location or address have been inspected.\r\n\r\nNote: All ACHD inspection reports and data posted on this web site are subject to errors and/or omissions. The cited violations are valid only as of the date of the inspection report. Inspection reports are uploaded monthly during the first week of the month and the upload includes new inspections up to the end of the preceding month.\r\n\r\nData is in three relational resources with the common field of Inspection ID.","num_resources":4,"num_tags":8,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

This analysis services as both an update to previous MVA’s commissioned separately by ACED and the URA and combines the MVA for the whole of Allegheny County (inclusive of the City of Pittsburgh). The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.  \r\n\r\nThis MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. The  data used covers the 2017-2019 period, and data used in the analysis includes:\r\n\r\n* Residential Real Estate Sales\r\n* Mortgage Foreclosures\r\n* Residential Vacancy\r\n* Parcel Year Built\r\n* Parcel Condition\r\n* Building Violations\r\n* Owner Occupancy\r\n* Subsidized Housing Units\r\n\r\nThe MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the presentation and executive summary for more information about the data, methodology, and findings.\r\n","num_resources":7,"num_tags":14,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

A similar MVA was completed with the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2016. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.\r\n\r\nThe 2016 Allegheny County MVA does not include the City of Pittsburgh, which was characterized at the same time in the fourth update of the City of Pittsburgh’s MVA. All calculations herein therefore do not include the City of Pittsburgh.\r\nWhile the methodology between the City and County MVA's are very similar, the classification of communities will differ, and so the data between the two should not be used interchangeably. \r\n\r\nAllegheny County's MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. Most data used covers the 2013-2016 period, and data used in the analysis includes:\r\n\r\n•Residential Real Estate Sales;\r\n• Mortgage Foreclosures;\r\n• Residential Vacancy;\r\n• Parcel Year Built;\r\n• Parcel Condition;\r\n• Owner Occupancy; and\r\n• Subsidized Housing Units.\r\n\r\nThe MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\r\n\r\nDuring the research process, staff from the County and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the report (included here as a pdf) for more information about the data, methodology, and findings.","num_resources":7,"num_tags":21,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-03-18T08:28:39.427825","description":"Allegheny County, in the heart of southwestern Pennsylvania, encompasses 130 municipalities; its county seat is the City of Pittsburgh.

The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis.

One of the Bureau of Police justifications for seizing a firearm involves a suspicion that a firearm was used in a criminal offense. Seizures may also occur to protect officer or public safety. For example, a weapon held by someone involved in a serious medical emergency, or an unattended  weapon found in a public space may be seized and held for safekeeping.\r\n \r\nThe Bureau’s firearms tracking unit conducts investigations to determine the rightful owner of firearms that have been seized. Where possible, the Bureau makes every effort to return firearms that have been seized to their rightful owners.\r\n \r\nFirearms seized by non-City of Pittsburgh law enforcement agencies within the City of Pittsburgh may not be included in this data.

The question was asked at occupied housing units that were for rent, vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nHousing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.\r\n\r\nContract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nIf the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, only that part of the rent estimated to be for the respondent's unit was included. Excluded was any rent paid for additional units or for business premises.\r\n\r\nIf a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge also is paid by the renter to the owner, the condominium fee or carrying charge was included as rent.\r\n\r\nIf a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers, was to be reported. The respondent was to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, a church or welfare agency, or the government through subsidies or vouchers.\r\n\r\nContract rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. When the data is used in conjunction with utility costs and income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels, and to provide assistance to agencies in determining policies on fair rent.\r\n\r\nAggregate Contract Rent – Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding all of the contract rents for occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. This explanation is comparable to the description used for Aggregate Gross Rent.

Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"755c09dc-be92-4787-84a6-080d84345979","last_modified":"2017-08-29T15:56:34.035440","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Educational Attainment for the Population 25 Years and Over","package_id":"c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449","position":3,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"eceeb3dd-7feb-4390-83f2-c3f7c0e46f18","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449/resource/755c09dc-be92-4787-84a6-080d84345979/download/educational-attainment-for-the-population-25-years-and-over.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-08-29T11:58:35.050785","datastore_active":true,"description":"The data on employment status were derived from Questions 29 and 35 to 37 in the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS).

The Census Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) vary by age (under 65 years or 65 years and older). The poverty thresholds for two-person families also vary by the age of the householder. If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that individual is considered to be in poverty. \r\n\r\nHow the Census Bureau Determines Poverty Status \r\n\r\nIn determining the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals, the Census Bureau uses thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families are further differentiated by age of reference person (householder) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). \r\n\r\nTo determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person’s total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see example below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered “below the poverty level,” together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold.\r\n\r\nPoverty Status of Households in the Past 12 Months \r\n\r\nSince poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder's family in the last 12 months is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for one- and two- person families, age of the householder.\r\n","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"7996d143-c155-466e-8414-115f74997dd7","last_modified":"2017-08-29T17:15:10.072349","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Poverty Status of Individuals in the Past 12 Months by Living Arrangements","package_id":"c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449","position":7,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"804db0a0-4a09-43ff-a63e-509dc5d1e05f","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449/resource/7996d143-c155-466e-8414-115f74997dd7/download/poverty-status-of-individuals-in-the-past-12-months-by-living-arrangement.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-08-29T13:16:00.568685","datastore_active":true,"description":"Public assistance income includes general assistance and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. \r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. \r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then 108 either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"466201c5-e8c4-4f1b-bdb0-66fe7ea651dd","last_modified":"2017-08-29T17:17:29.555776","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Race","package_id":"c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449","position":9,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"7d44d77f-8058-4c03-899d-f024005f0bdf","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449/resource/466201c5-e8c4-4f1b-bdb0-66fe7ea651dd/download/race.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-08-29T13:33:10.028038","datastore_active":false,"description":"The data on Food Stamp benefits were obtained from Housing Question 15 in the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS).

Data on vacancy status were obtained at the time of the personal visit. Vacancy status and other characteristics of vacant units were determined by field representatives obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental agents, and others.\r\n\r\nVacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nVacant units are subdivided according to their housing market classification as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Rent – These are vacant units offered “for rent,” and vacant units offered either “for rent” or “for sale.” Rented, Not Occupied – These are vacant units rented but not yet occupied, including units where money has been paid or agreed upon, but the renter has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Sale Only – These are vacant units being offered “for sale only,” including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered “for sale only.” If units are offered either “for rent” or “for sale” they are included in the “for rent” classification.\r\n\r\nSold, Not Occupied – These are vacant units sold but not yet occupied, including units that have been sold recently, but the new owner has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use – These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or timesharing condominiums, also are included here.\r\n\r\nFor Migrant Workers – These include vacant units intended for occupancy by migratory workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.)\r\n\r\nOther Vacant – If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other vacant.” For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the owner.\r\n\r\nHomeowner Vacancy Rate – The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant “for sale.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of the owner-occupied units, vacant units that are “for sale only,” and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nRental Vacancy Rate – The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant “for rent.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for rent” by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are “for rent,” and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nAvailable Housing Vacancy Rate – The proportion of the housing inventory that is vacant for-sale only and vacant-for-rent. It is computed by dividing the sum of vacant-for-sale only housing units and vacant-for-rent housing units, by the sum of occupied units, vacant-for-sale only housing units, vacant-sold-not occupied housing units, vacant-for-rent housing units, and vacant-rented-not-occupied housing units, and then multiplying by 100.

Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs.","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"c9fd5859-ed34-4151-a13e-d7a25839f4d3","last_modified":"2017-08-07T16:43:44.964595","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Types of Health Insurance Coverage, By Age","package_id":"5b18c198-474c-4723-b735-cc5220ad43cc","position":1,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"a04f7c01-a8bb-4162-afe6-0fc0f9c80b97","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/5b18c198-474c-4723-b735-cc5220ad43cc/resource/c9fd5859-ed34-4151-a13e-d7a25839f4d3/download/types-of-health-insurance-coverage-by-age.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-08-07T12:44:20.044857","datastore_active":true,"description":"The data on contract rent (also referred to as \"rent asked\" for vacant units) were obtained from questionnaire item H24, which was asked at all occupied housing units that were rented for cash rent and all vacant housing units that were for rent at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nHousing units that are renter occupied without payment of cash rent are not part of the universe for contract rent.

The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"13982f58-e618-400c-8f69-6a32dbd7c68f","last_modified":"2017-08-07T17:00:00.809910","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Housing Unit Value","package_id":"5b18c198-474c-4723-b735-cc5220ad43cc","position":4,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"3f7b5f27-20cd-46d0-8321-0dfe2143d016","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/5b18c198-474c-4723-b735-cc5220ad43cc/resource/13982f58-e618-400c-8f69-6a32dbd7c68f/download/value.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-08-07T13:24:45.505969","datastore_active":true,"description":"Wage or salary income includes total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the past 12 months.

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth.","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"c6707c65-a904-43b9-a933-3600f79aaa3b","last_modified":"2017-08-08T18:38:02.556015","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Sex by Age","package_id":"5b18c198-474c-4723-b735-cc5220ad43cc","position":17,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"0c823b76-5d1f-4110-8574-ab4436aeec68","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/5b18c198-474c-4723-b735-cc5220ad43cc/resource/c6707c65-a904-43b9-a933-3600f79aaa3b/download/sex-by-age.csv","url_type":"upload"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-08-08T15:14:26.232020","datastore_active":true,"description":"A housing unit may be a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms or a single room that is occupied (or, if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census. For more information, see “Comparing 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates of Occupancy Status, Vacancy Status, and Household Size with the 2010 Census – Preliminary Results” on the ACS website.

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation.\r\n\r\nData on school enrollment and grade or level attending were derived from answers to Question 10 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). People were classified as enrolled in school if they were attending a public or private school or college at any time during the 3 months prior to the time of interview. The question included instructions to “include only nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, home school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma, or a college degree.” Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of\r\na person with the same age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or nearby area.\r\n\r\nSchool enrollment is only recorded if the schooling advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or medicine) degree. Tutoring or correspondence schools are included if credit can be obtained from a public or private school or college. People enrolled in “vocational, technical, or business school” such as post secondary vocational, trade, hospital school, and\r\non job training were not reported as enrolled in school. Field interviewers were instructed to classify individuals who were home schooled as enrolled in private school. The guide sent out with the mail questionnaire includes instructions for how to classify home schoolers.\r\n\r\nEnrolled in Public and Private School – Includes people who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for “public school, public college,” or “private school, private college, home school.” The instruction guide defines a public school as “any school or college controlled and supported primarily by a local, county, state, or federal government.” Private schools are defined as schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups. Home schools are defined as “parental-guided education outside of public or private school for grades 1-12.” Respondents who marked both the “public” and “private”\r\nboxes are edited to the first entry, “public.”\r\n\r\nGrade in Which Enrolled – From 1999-2007, in the ACS, people reported to be enrolled in “public school, public college” or “private school, private college” were classified by grade or level according to responses to Question 10b, “What grade or level was this person attending?” Seven levels were identified: “nursery school, preschool;” “kindergarten;” elementary “grade 1 to grade 4” or “grade 5 to grade 8;” high school “grade 9 to grade 12;” “college undergraduate years (freshman to senior);” and “graduate or professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school).”\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the school enrollment questions had several changes. “Home school” was explicitly included in the “private school, private college” category. For question 10b the categories changed to the following “Nursery school, preschool,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 12,” “College undergraduate years (freshman to senior),” “Graduate or professional school beyond a bachelor’s degree (for example: MA or PhD program, or medical or law school).” The survey question allowed a write-in for the grades enrolled from 1-12.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS enrollment status question (Question 10a) refers to “regular school or college,” while the 1996-1998 ACS did not restrict reporting to “regular” school, and contained an additional category for the “vocational, technical or business school.” The 1996-1998 ACS used the educational attainment question to estimate level of enrollment for those reported to be enrolled in school, and had a single year write-in for the attainment of\r\ngrades 1 through 11. Grade levels estimated using the attainment question were not consistent with other estimates, so a new question specifically asking grade or level of enrollment was added starting with the 1999 ACS questionnaire.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population universe in the ACS includes people living in group quarters. Data users may see slight differences in levels of school enrollment in any given geographic area due to the inclusion of this population. The extent of this difference, if any, depends on the type of group quarters present and whether the group quarters population makes up a large proportion of the total population. For example, in areas that are home to several colleges and universities, the percent of individuals 18 to 24 who were enrolled in college or graduate school would increase, as people living in college dormitories are now included in the universe.","num_resources":11,"num_tags":8,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-02-12T13:34:12.747165","description":"

Occupation data were derived from answers to questions 45 and 46 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). Question 45 asks: “What kind of work was this person doing?” Question 46 asks: “What were this person’s most important activities or duties?”\r\n\r\nThese questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over who had worked in the past 5 years. For employed people, the data refer to the person’s job during the previous week. For those who worked two or more jobs, the data refer to the job where the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed people and people who are not currently employed but report having a job within the last five years, the data refer to their last job.\r\n\r\nThese questions describe the work activity and occupational experience of the American labor force. Data are used to formulate policy and programs for employment, career development, and training; to provide information on the occupational skills of the labor force in a given area to analyze career trends; and to measure compliance with antidiscrimination policies. Companies use these data to decide where to locate new plants, stores, or offices.

The question on relationship is essential for classifying the population information on families and other groups. Information about changes in the composition of the American family, from the number of people living alone to the number of children living with only one parent, is essential for planning and carrying out a number of federal programs.\r\n\r\nThe responses to this question were used to determine the relationships of all persons to the householder, as well as household type (married couple family, nonfamily, etc.). From responses to this question, we were able to determine numbers of related children, own children, unmarried partner households, and multi-generational households. We calculated average household and family size. When relationship was not reported, it was imputed using the age difference between the householder and the person, sex, and marital status.\r\n\r\nHousehold – A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living arrangements.\r\n\r\nAverage Household Size – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in\r\nhouseholds by the number of households. In cases where people in households are cross-classified by race or Hispanic origin, people in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual.\r\n\r\nAverage household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth.\r\n\r\nComparability – The relationship categories for the most part can be compared to previous ACS years and to similar data collected in the decennial census, CPS, and SIPP. With the change in 2008 from “In-law” to the two categories of “Parent-in-law” and “Son-in-law or daughter-in-law,” caution should be exercised when comparing data on in-laws from previous years. “In-law” encompassed any type of in-law such as sister-in-law. Combining “Parent-in-law” and “son-in-law or daughter-in-law” does not represent all “in-laws” in 2008. \r\n\r\nThe same can be said of comparing the three categories of “biological” “step,” and “adopted” child in 2008 to “Child” in previous years. Before 2008, respondents may have considered anyone under 18 as “child” and chosen that category. The ACS includes “foster child” as a category. However, the 2010 Census did not contain this category, and “foster children” were included in the “Other nonrelative” category. Therefore, comparison of “foster child” cannot be made to the 2010 Census. Beginning in 2013, the “spouse” category includes same-sex spouses.

These data are used to manage and track all updates to casefiles by city employees and can be used to understand when citations/investigations/court proceedings are issued, the nature and location of the violation, and the status of the casefile at any point in time. By using addresses or parcel numbers, which are contained in these data, users can also display information on geospatial maps.\r\n\r\n## Collection/Interpretation\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand the distinction between violations and casefiles, and how updates to a casefile are represented in the dataset. A casefile refers to one or more violations. When an initial investigation is conducted each of these violations is recorded separately. The investigation will result in a new status for all of violations (“VIOLATIONS FOUND”). The subject of the investigation will be informed of this outcome and must address the problem(s). There will be a follow-up inspection at this point, and depending on the results, further steps will be taken (follow-up investigations, criminal complaints issued, court proceedings, etc.)\r\n\r\nEach violation for each casefile is represented as a unique row in the dataset. As explained above, there will be a minimum of two updates for each violation (the initial and follow-up investigation). Though the investigation of all violations in a casefile is conducted simultaneously, each investigation is represented as a unique row. Thus, for a property with three violations there will be a minimum of six rows (both investigations for each violation). It is possible to track the entire case history by observing all rows for each casefile.\r\n\r\nEach violation is cited according to the `violation_code_section` field.\r\n\r\nThe `casefile_number` represents the only UUID for each __casefile__ (the entire group of violations). By using the `casefile_number` and `violation_code_section` fields in combination, one can track the history each violation for a given casefile. Combining the above fields with investigation_date renders a UUID for each record.\r\n\r\nDOMI (the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure), PLI, and Environmental Services all use this system to log violations (though publication of Environmental Services violations is still pending). In most cases, the department involved in the casefile can be extracted from the `casefile_number` field (beginning with the 4th character). For instance,  a `casefile_number` like CF-**PLI**-2021-025422, represents a violation reported by PLI. The remaining casefile IDs start with \"O-\"; these are PLI violation codes from an old ticketing system.\r\n\r\n## Preprocessing/Formatting\r\n\r\nAll string text (most fields) were converted to UPPERCASE data. The data are manually entered and often contain non-uniform formatting. While several solutions for cleaning the data exist, including allowing the user to clean the data after accessing it here, text field values were transformed to UPPERCASE to ensure the data were uniformly formatted in this case. Future improvements to this ETL pipeline may approach this problem with a more sophisticated technique.","num_resources":5,"num_tags":13,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-02-12T13:34:12.747165","description":" ","id":"9ecaff80-fb4a-457b-8141-e53f7c991890","image_url":"20150212-183412.702478k1fmeh7gvmv2viv3h0wjnn89f.gif","is_organization":true,"name":"city-of-pittsburgh","revision_id":"8d60e904-2a50-4162-9032-80fda6b6e5f3","state":"active","title":"City of Pittsburgh","type":"organization"},"owner_org":"9ecaff80-fb4a-457b-8141-e53f7c991890","private":false,"related_documents":"","relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2023-02-08T20:22:52.963373","datastore_active":true,"description":"","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"70c06278-92c5-4040-ab28-17671866f81c","last_modified":"2023-05-04T03:46:48.345620","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Violations","package_id":"d660edf8-9157-45ad-a282-50822badfaae","position":0,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"73e1ccdc-a8ce-4f53-88db-9d6258854b34","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/70c06278-92c5-4040-ab28-17671866f81c","url_type":"datapusher"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-03-27T11:53:39.511730","datastore_active":false,"description":"This data is used in our property dashboard.","format":"HTML","hash":"","id":"5d4d2d72-903b-4b3e-bf83-18aa0680ad9e","last_modified":null,"mimetype":"text/html","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Property Dashboard","package_id":"d660edf8-9157-45ad-a282-50822badfaae","position":1,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"95bebcb9-2269-42b0-a870-ca592549156e","size":null,"state":"active","url":"http://tools.wprdc.org/property-dashboard/","url_type":null},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2017-04-07T11:11:32.885784","datastore_active":false,"description":"With Burgh's Eye View you can easily see all kinds of data about Pittsburgh.","format":"HTML","hash":"","id":"5e4cac2a-0f25-42e5-980e-092ca2235ae1","last_modified":null,"mimetype":"text/html","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Burgh's Eye View","package_id":"d660edf8-9157-45ad-a282-50822badfaae","position":2,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"602869ad-22eb-4d49-bc70-1ef928cd65de","size":null,"state":"active","url":"https://pittsburghpa.shinyapps.io/BurghsEyeView","url_type":null},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2015-12-04T11:17:27.797629","datastore_active":true,"description":"Report containing City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections violation notices that have been issued by the City after October 15, 2015 and through May 7, 2020.

Service runs every 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nOTP only goes back as far as November 2018 for the \"T\" light rail line because the railcars did not have Automated Vehicle Locators installed until then.","num_resources":2,"num_tags":9,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2016-09-30T10:12:20.427408","description":"Pittsburgh Regional Transit provides public transportation throughout Pittsburgh and Allegheny County in southwestern Pennsylvania.","id":"0666b732-fc3f-4568-b780-1b457a1b25e7","image_url":"2022-06-24-133218.266161PRT-Logo.png","is_organization":true,"name":"pittsburgh-regional-transit","revision_id":"b19ed7d6-9af2-40b7-8640-6002adf2b533","state":"active","title":"Pittsburgh Regional Transit","type":"organization"},"owner_org":"0666b732-fc3f-4568-b780-1b457a1b25e7","private":false,"related_documents":"","relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2019-10-02T20:57:56.917433","datastore_active":true,"description":"","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"00eb9600-69b5-4f11-b20a-8c8ddd8cfe7a","last_modified":"2023-05-02T03:37:33.744050","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Monthly OTP by Route","package_id":"b8b5fee7-2281-4426-a68e-2e05c6dec365","position":0,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"ecb16976-8977-455f-9202-d96028a1dc6a","size":762405,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/00eb9600-69b5-4f11-b20a-8c8ddd8cfe7a","url_type":"datapusher"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2019-10-03T13:07:22.000494","datastore_active":true,"description":"","format":"CSV","hash":"","id":"999ab5cc-1381-41ec-8d8e-163dfc18ed60","last_modified":"2019-11-13T02:42:56.789236","mimetype":"text/csv","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"OTP Data Dictionary","package_id":"b8b5fee7-2281-4426-a68e-2e05c6dec365","position":1,"resource_type":null,"revision_id":"45b72bd2-51e7-4dca-bf66-c22b4aaf6d6d","size":1204,"state":"active","url":"https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/b8b5fee7-2281-4426-a68e-2e05c6dec365/resource/999ab5cc-1381-41ec-8d8e-163dfc18ed60/download/routemonthlyotp-data-dictionary.csv","url_type":"upload"}],"revision_id":"a2a47a4f-7641-4526-a618-d0f62adbc04c","state":"active","tags":[{"display_name":"OTP","id":"e861146d-0a58-4b0c-8e91-272514405b0e","name":"OTP","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"_etl","id":"11a2ac1d-0f6e-4f88-a1d0-8eca46578f77","name":"_etl","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"bus","id":"cfec4804-edb4-4526-a7ad-68cf06d180b6","name":"bus","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"calls for service","id":"d2102899-6274-42d2-a652-7b3021387158","name":"calls for service","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"on time performance","id":"bb64811b-d4b4-4722-9577-30ceb33a580d","name":"on time performance","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"performance","id":"f6d86ead-5acc-4ab8-b7bb-9a6fbff3ef47","name":"performance","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"rail","id":"659bdf14-b9cc-4359-b9c7-cb6eb0b2d1fd","name":"rail","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"reliability","id":"3dcdbcfe-9738-4f90-939d-7306bc714bbc","name":"reliability","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null},{"display_name":"transit","id":"cf49301d-23aa-4a87-9652-a957c2ab53d7","name":"transit","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null}],"temporal_coverage":"2017-01-01/2023-03-01","title":"Port Authority Monthly On Time Performance by Route","type":"dataset","url":null,"version":null}

Robert K. Nelson, LaDale Winling, Richard Marciano, Nathan Connolly, et al., “Mapping Inequality,” American Panorama, ed. Robert K. Nelson and Edward L. Ayers,\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\"HOLC staff members, using data and evaluations organized by local real estate professionals--lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers--in each city, assigned grades to residential neighborhoods that reflected their \"mortgage security\" that would then be visualized on color-coded maps. Neighborhoods receiving the highest grade of \"A\"--colored green on the maps--were deemed minimal risks for banks and other mortgage lenders when they were determining who should received loans and which areas in the city were safe investments. Those receiving the lowest grade of \"D,\" colored red, were considered \"hazardous.\"  <br>\r\n\r\nConservative, responsible lenders, in HOLC judgment, would \"refuse to make loans in these areas [or] only on a conservative basis.\" HOLC created area descriptions to help to organize the data they used to assign the grades. Among that information was the neighborhood's quality of housing, the recent history of sale and rent values, and, crucially, the racial and ethnic identity and class of residents that served as the basis of the neighborhood's grade. These maps and their accompanying documentation helped set the rules for nearly a century of real estate practice. \" \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nHOLC agents grading cities through this program largely \"adopted a consistently white, elite standpoint or perspective. HOLC assumed and insisted that the residency of African Americans and immigrants, as well as working-class whites, compromised the values of homes and the security of mortgages. In this they followed the guidelines set forth by Frederick Babcock, the central figure in early twentieth-century real estate appraisal standards, in his Underwriting Manual: \"The infiltration of inharmonious racial groups ... tend to lower the levels of land values and to lessen the desirability of residential areas.\"   <br>\r\n\r\nThese grades were a tool for redlining: making it difficult or impossible for people in certain areas to access mortgage financing and thus become homeowners. Redlining directed both public and private capital to native-born white families and away from African American and immigrant families. As homeownership was arguably the most significant means of intergenerational wealth building in the United States in the twentieth century, these redlining practices from eight decades ago had long-term effects in creating wealth inequalities that we still see today. Mapping Inequality, we hope, will allow and encourage you to grapple with this history of government policies contributing to inequality.\"  \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nData was copied from the Mapping Inequality Website for communities in Western Pennsylvania where data was available.

While there is no standard definition of what makes a community “walkable”, and the definition of “walkability” can differ from person to person, we thought an indicator that explores the total length of available sidewalks relative to the total length of streets in a community could be a good place to start. In this blog post, we describe how we used open data from SPC and Allegheny County to create a new measure for how “walkable” a community is. We wanted to create a ratio of the length of a community’s sidewalks to the length of a community’s streets as a measure of pedestrian infrastructure. A ratio of 1 would mean that a community has an equal number of linear feet of sidewalks and streets. A ratio of about 2 would mean that a community has two linear feet of sidewalk for every linear foot of street. In other words, every street has a sidewalk on either side of it. \r\nIn creating a measure of the ratio of streets to sidewalks, we had to do a little bit of data cleanup. Much of this was by trial and error, ground-truthing the data based on our personal  experiences walking in different neighborhoods. Since street data was not shared as open data by many counties in our region either on PASDA or through the SPC open data portal, we limited our analysis of “walkability” to Allegheny County.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the sidewalk data table and map, we noticed that  trails were included. While nice to have in the data, we wanted to exclude these two features from the ratio. We did this to avoid a situation where a community that had few sidewalks but was in the same blockgroup as a park with trails would get “credit” for being more “walkable” than it actually is according to our definition. We did this by removing all segments where “Trail” was in the “Type_Name” field.\r\n\r\nWe also used a similar tabular selection method to remove crosswalks from the sidewalk data “Type_Name”=”Crosswalk.” We kept the steps in the dataset along with the sidewalks. \r\n\r\n In the street data obtained from Allegheny County’s GIS department, we felt like we should try to exclude limited-access highway segments from the analysis, since pedestrians are prohibited from using them, and their presence would have reduced the sidewalk/street ratio in communities where they are located. We did this by excluding street segments whose values in the “FCC” field (designating type of street) equaled “A11” or “A63.” We also removed trails from this dataset by excluding those classified as “H10.” Since documentation was sparse, we looked to see how these features were classified in the data to determine which codes to exclude.\r\n\r\nAfter running the data initially, we also realized that excluding alleyways from the calculations also could improve the accuracy of our results. Some of the communities with substantial pedestrian infrastructure have alleyways, and including them would make them appear to be less-”walkable” in our indicator. We removed these from the dataset by removing records with a value of “Aly” or “Way” in the “St_Type” field. We also excluded streets where the word “Alley” appeared in the street name, or “St_Name” field.\r\n\r\nThe full methodology used for this dataset is captured in our [blog post](https://www.wprdc.org/news/measuring-walkability/), and we have also included the sidewalk and street data used to create the ratio here as well.","num_resources":5,"num_tags":4,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2016-09-26T10:45:37.586125","description":"","id":"4eb88a01-738a-4ca1-96e4-b0bf8d3ec3dc","image_url":"2017-06-16-215251.206181WPRDC-Organization-Page-Logo.jpg","is_organization":true,"name":"wprdc","revision_id":"73359062-f86a-4184-b7d1-e2e1eeb22a11","state":"active","title":"Western

Due to high energy and maintenance costs, the City is developing a plan to replace the bulk of this system with remotely managed LED luminaires, with the goal being a potential energy savings of 60-80%. These savings can finance the conversion program through an Energy Savings Performance Contract. The City has previously piloted this approach in 2012, upgrading 4,500 luminaires through a State-funded energy savings program.  \r\n\r\nThe City recognizes that updated streetlights can offer a ready-made physical and communications platform for the sensors, controls and backhaul that power a Smart City. In the case of a Smart Streetlight deployment however, the problem is not pre-defined, so it is unclear what the City may actually need. This is why the City chose to release an RFI instead of the more common Request for Proposals (RFP), in order to understand the state of the industry, perform a market analysis and provide a learning experience for City personnel.  This RFI was designed to help the City understand the industry's perspective on these emerging technologies while providing a more efficient and equitable lighting system. \r\n\r\nThe City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget released the Smart Streetlights RFI on March 2nd, 2017 and closed it on April 10th, 2017.  The City received twenty-five responses from different businesses who offered a wide variety of services, products and concepts. All of the responses, as well as the RFI itself and the resulting questions and answers, are available to view.\r\n\r\n##\"Smart Cities\"\r\n\r\nThe term \"Smart City\" refers to a range of technologies designed to sense and control various real-world phenomena, and software design and development projects to collect, present and administer those technologies' data and functions. \r\n\r\n##LEDs\r\n\r\nLEDs have a higher efficiency in their conversion of electricity to light. LEDs also last much longer than sodium lamps. They also allow for fine-tuned control to maximize energy savings and performance.

Every decade we issue a comprehensive report on aging in Allegheny County and this report represents our most recent effort.  It documents important shifts in the demographic profile of the population in the last three decades, characterizes the current status of the elderly in multiple life domains, and looks ahead to the future of aging in the County.  This report is unique in that we examine not only those aged 65 and older, but also the next generation old persons, the Baby Boomers.  Collaborators on this project include the Allegheny County Area Agency on Aging, the United Way of Allegheny County, and the Aging Institute of UPMC Senior Services and the University of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\n The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of aging in Allegheny County.  To this end, we integrate survey data collected from a representative sample of older county residents with secondary data available from Federal, State, and County agencies to characterize older individuals on multiple dimensions, including demographic change and population projections, income, work and retirement, neighborhoods and housing, health, senior service use, transportation, volunteering, happiness and life satisfaction, among others.  Since baby boomers represent the future of aging in the County we include data for those aged 55-64 as well as those aged 65 and older.","num_resources":6,"num_tags":5,"organization":{"approval_status":"approved","created":"2015-09-22T17:46:53.149751","description":"The University of Pittsburgh is a state-related research university, founded as the Pittsburgh Academy in 1787.

Counters were deployed as part of traffic studies, including intersection studies, and studies covering where or whether to install speed humps. In some cases, data may have been collected by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC) or BikePGH.\r\n\r\nData is currently available for only the most-recent count at each location. \r\n\r\nTraffic count data is important to the process for deciding where to install speed humps. According to DOMI, they may only be legally installed on streets where traffic counts fall below a minimum threshhold. Residents can [request an evaluation](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6554_application.pdf) of their street as part of DOMI's [Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/traffic-calming). The City has also shared [data on the impact of the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/traffic-calming-data) in reducing speeds. \r\n\r\nDifferent studies may collect different data. Speed hump studies capture counts and speeds.  SPC and BikePGH conduct  counts of cyclists. Intersection studies included in this dataset may not include traffic counts, but reports of individual studies may be requested from the City. Despite the lack of count data, intersection studies are included to facilitate data requests. \r\n\r\nData captured by different types of counting devices are included in this data.  StatTrak counters are  in use by the City, and capture data on counts and speeds. More information about these devices may be found on the [company's website](https://www.alltrafficsolutions.com/stattrakvehiclecounterclassifier/).  Data includes traffic counts and average speeds, and may also include separate counts of bicycles.\r\n\r\nTubes are deployed by both SPC and BikePGH and used to count cyclists. SPC may also deploy video counters to collect data. \r\n\r\n**NOTE: The data in this dataset has not updated since 2021 because of a broken data feed.
